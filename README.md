# LSPosed-documented  
A fork of the [LSPosed project](https://github.com/LSPosed). The purpose of this fork is to add documentations since the original project is loosely documented. Both _code comments_ and _wiki documentation_ will be added for easier reading and understang the project.  

Please, checkout corresponding branch (switch from [**master**]). Currently supporting only v1.8.6 - checkout branch [**lsposed-v1.8.6**]
